# hello-world

Greetings!

Umutcan is here! I'm 18 and I'm Turk. Why am i here? Actually I don't know. I wonder everything and everyone. Likely I'll be not become a software writer or other else something like this. But I want to text here somethings Altough you can't see my texts xD

Proving myself to my father is my first goal. Because I always break to his hope... And I'm making my dad angry so that I feel piece of trash. If I die, please send this writing to my family, We are living in Ä°zmir. I think you can find easily our adress :)

Dad, I want to be your happy. And I'm sorry break your hopes on me. You're always. I'm Internet addicted. I'm dumb and I'm stupid... If I'll dont make you happy, forgive me. If you see this writing, dont cry. Because I dont want to cry. 

Okay, let's back our business. I want to try something about coding. Maybe I can write something about it in the future. C'ya.
